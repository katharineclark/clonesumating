<P>If you don't want to cut and paste, you can use our handy <A href="/invite/">invite tool</a>, where you can simply type your friend's email address.</p>

<P><span class="subtitle">Share Your Profile</span><Br />
Your profile is permanently located at the address below.  Send it to your friends so they can see your answers and can vote for you in the contests!</p>

<P><span class="subtitle">Fill Out Your Profile By Answering Questions</span><br />
Every week, we posts a new question, and all of your answers appear on your profile.   You can see the newest question <A href="/qow.pl">here</a>,
or you can browse the archive of questions <A href="/play/">by clicking the Participate link</a> at the top of every page.  Answering questions
will earn you popularity points, and it allows you to share your opinions and quirky personality with the community.</p>

<P class="alert medium">Enough!  <A href="/qow.pl">I want to answer this week's question.</a></p>

<P><span class="subtitle">Enter The Photo Contest</span><br />
We also host a themed photo contest each week.  We select a theme, and everyone uploads a photo of themselves with that theme 
in a competition to see who can have the <i>awesomest</i> photo.  You wondered why everyone has such silly photos?  That's why.
</p>

<P class="medium alert">You've convinced me, <a href="/play/photos/index.pl/current">I want to enter the photo contest.</a></p>

<p><span class="subtitle">Tag Yourself</span><br />
Tags are short, descriptive words that you can attach to yourself to define who you are and the sort of things you are into.  Having tags
that really describe your interests -- your hobbies, your favorite tv shows, books, movies and bands, and anything that you identify with -- 
helps us find cool people to introduce you to.  You can add tags to yourself at any time straight from your profile.  You can also
be tagged by other people!</p>

<P class="medium alert"><a href="/profiles/<cms::var type="user" name="linkhandle">/tags">I want to add some tags to my profile.</a></p>

<P><span class="subtitle">Find A New Friend</span><br />
At the core of the site is Consmating's people finding technology.  Search for people by tag using the box at the top of every page.  When you do,
we'll try to find people who share a lot of your interests, live nearby, and generally seem like nice folks.   You can find people <A href="/tags/coffee">who love coffee</a>, people
who <a href="/tags/camping">like to camp</a> and <a href="/tags/hike">hike</a>, people who <a href="/tags/curbyourenthusiasm">watch Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, people who
<a href="/tags/zombies">love zombies</a>, and...uh, you get the point!</p>

<p class="medium alert"><A href="/tags/">Get out of my way and let me find some people who don't suck!</a></p>
