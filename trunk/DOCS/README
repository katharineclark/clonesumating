SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

	Apache with mod_perl
	FastCGI (FCGI and CGI::Fast)
	Memcache
	Mysql
	Image::Magick
	All Perl modules required should be freely available at http://search.cpan.org	


CONFIGURING CONSUCODE TO WORK ON YOUR SERVER

	1. Install all the code and images into a web root somewhere
	2. Make changes to your apache config so that the mod_perl modules get mapped correctly
	3. Make sure your photos dir is writable by your web server
	4. Make sure your img/toys dir is writable by your web server
	5. Import database schema into your mysql server
	6. Update lib/CONFIG.pm with database login, domain names, paths, etc
	7. HACK TIL IT WORKS
	8. Modify templates in /front/
	9. Modify styles in /css/
	10. There are a few cron jobs in /admin/cron/  They need to be set up to run regularly.
	

CUSTOMIZING CATEGORIES, ETC

	1. You'll want to fill a few databases with categories for your users. 	 
		=> topicChannels - a list of all channels a topic can be in
	2. In the /admin/ dir, there are a few simple admin tools.
			1. qow.pl - creates new questions of the week
			2. photoContest.pl - creates new photo contests, archives old ones.
			3. spammers.pl - this is the queue of people who have been reported as spammers
	3. There are a bunch of email alerts and notifications in /front/emails and /front/alerts


EXPERIMENTAL CODE
	There is some fun, slightly newer versions of the peeps page, play page, etc in the EXPERIMENTAL dir.
	None of this stuff will work out of the box, but you can see where the code is going.

KNOWN ISSUES

	1. The drawing tool does not work in IE. It may look like it is working, but it will fail in the end.
	2. Sometimes, toys mysteriously disappear. I think this has to do with them moving instead of copying.
	3. Sometimes, posting to a topic doesn't work, or it posts double. 
	4. Misc javascript errors from time to time.
	5. Sometimes the verification emails get lost. We hear that the date on the emails may be totally jacked. 
	6. No admin tool for simple user problems
	7. Message points do not reset automatically at beginning of month
	8. New Question and new photo contest alerts do not automatically send
	9. There is no easy way to invite people to meetings
	

SHORT TERM PLANS

	1. Modularize functionality further so that things like tags, toys, photo contest, question of the week are 
		reasonably plug and play
	2. Merge / improve tag pages and people browser.  New interface required to expose all the fun stuff
	   with tag quirkyness and tag combinations
	3. Better default set of templates and styles
	4. Kill remaining perl and fastcgi so that everything is mod_perl
	5. Admin tools suite

	The code as it stands was built to utilize VideoEgg for video sharing.  You will have to
	become a VideoEgg partner before you can use the same code.  I recommend finding your own
	video hosting solution and modifying the code.   But VideoEgg rules.
	
	Zip Proximity Database.   The localization stuff will not work until you provide some
	method for deciding what local means.  Traditionally we have used a database that
	cross references zip codes to local zip codes.  You can do this however you like - 
	just make sure the local queries get updated.
